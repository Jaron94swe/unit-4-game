    <h1>Crystal Collector</h1>
    <p>The goal of this game, is to click the 4 buttons below. Each button is set to a random number, in which you will
        have to figure out each set amount. Once you have clicked a button the number for that button will be the same.
        you have a total of your score, which is the lowest number you see on the screen. There is a number which is
        randomly generated and is displayed next to the word "Goal". if the total number of score eauals the goals
        number, you win and your wins go up by one. However, if you go over the number, you lose. In which you will see
        the lose section go up by one. Once your number equals or proceeds the goal number, the game will reset, with
        new buttons and a new goal to work towards.
        Goodluck!
